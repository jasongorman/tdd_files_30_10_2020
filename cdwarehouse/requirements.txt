Customers can buy CDs, searching on the title and the
artist. Record labels send batches of CDs to the warehouse. Keep a
stock count of how many copies of each title are in the warehouse.

Customers can leave reviews for CDs theyâ€™ve bought through the
warehouse, which gives each title an integer rating from 1- 10 and
the text of their review if they want to say more.
